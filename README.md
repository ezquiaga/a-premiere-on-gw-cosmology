# A premiere on Gravitationl Wave Cosmology

Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences are unique cosmic messengers. This repository contains materials for a course at the level of advanced undergraduate and graduate students with a background in general relativity. 

A detailed course description can be found in the [wiki page](https://github.com/ezquiaga/a-premiere-on-gw-cosmology/wiki).

Most of the materials are based on our course on [Black Holes and Gravitational Waves](https://github.com/MvdMeent/BlackHolesandGravitationalWaves) at the Niels Bohr Institute.
